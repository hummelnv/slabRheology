# slabRheology
Supplemental materials for "The influence of viscous slab rheology on numerical models of subduction", EGU Solid Earth. The repository contains model outputs and code used to produce figures.
The files output by SULEC from each model are labeled as follows: linViscReference is the linear viscous reference model, diffPlas is the diffusion creep-only model, diffDisl is the model with 
diffusion-dislocation in parallel, dislPlas is the dislocation-only model, and viscPlas is the linear viscous model with a slab viscoisty of 1e25. The .out files contained in each zipped file 
can be opened and plotted using the included MATLAB code.
